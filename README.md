Fluent Python - Book Group for 2nd Edition
=================================

This repo is the source of material that was used when a group study session was conducted to
better understand the python programming language and help us all become a little more pythonic.

Setup
-------------------------

This is pretty straightfoward to setup.  I did use conda to setup the environment, but all pip
dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`.  You can either create an environment using
the supplied python environment file, or you can use your own solution.

**NOTE** This repo is expecting python 3.10 to be used as we will be demonstrating some of the
new features.

Once you have your solution setup you can install the dependencies using the below command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will have dependencies setup, next you can start the notebook service by running the following

    jupyter lab
