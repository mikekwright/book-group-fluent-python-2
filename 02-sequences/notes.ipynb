    "It is important to realize that there are two main \"families\" of sequences that are built-in to the python language (implementation will be in C for optimization)\n",
    "1. Container\n",
    "2. Flat\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is what they can hold and how they are optimized in memory for use.  Those in the `Container` family can hold complex objects, which could include other containers.  These include collections such as `list`, `tuple`, `map`, etc.  The `Flat` sequences are less flexible but more optimized and can only hold simple types, and must be the same type for all values.  These sequences include `array.array`, `str`, `bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day this is really to handle memory optimization.  When you use a `Container` the identity of each of the elements must be captured in a given entry, where the flat can keep some \"metadata\" only once for optimization."
